# google-app-engine-web-app

This is a project from Udacity course on creating web application. Its a blog that displays up to 8 blog posts at a 
time. The blog allows the user to submit posts as well and then display their own blog post.The code written by me is
in Python, and since the highlight of the course was learning web application it came with pre-written HTML templates. I did make changes to some of the HTML code as my coding logic/method diverges from the course as I solved the problem in a way that worked for me but still accomplished the goal of the project - cumulatively building upto creating a blog.
