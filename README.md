# google-app-engine-web-app

This is a project from Udacity course using the google app engine. Its a blog that displays up to 8 blog posts at a 
time. The blog allows the user to submit posts as well and then display their own blog post.The code written by me is 
in Python, and since the highlight of the course was learning web application it came with pre-written HTML templates.
